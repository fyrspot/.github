# 🗼 Fyrspot  

**Fyrspot** is a privacy-first experiment in secure, peer-to-peer style messaging.
Think of it as sending encrypted “beacons” that only the right people (or devices) can see.

No central servers storing your private keys. No cloud lock-in. Just keys, trust, and discovery.

---

## 🚀 What is this?
- A backend service (Go + Redis/Postgres) that lets users publish and receive encrypted beacons.
- Mobile apps (WIP) where you can create an identity, generate device keys, and start receiving beacons.
- End-to-end encryption with support for multiple devices per user — without storing private keys on the server.

## 🌍 Why Fyrspot?
We wanted a **hackable**, **lightweight**, and **privacy-friendly** way to share location-based signals or messages.
This isn’t polished. It’s an experiment, a playground, and maybe a tool.

## 👾 Contribution Vibes  
This is a **hackerspace in code form**. PRs, weird ideas, experiments, forks — all welcome.
- Found a bug? Open an issue.
- Got an idea? Drop it in Discussions.
- Want to build a new client? Go for it.

Don’t worry about polish — this org is about **messing around and seeing what sticks**.
